1. For using maven local repository from gradle:
=======================================================

Maven plugin needs to be added. 

plugins {
    id 'java-library'
    id 'maven'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version "1.0.10.RELEASE"
}

Add mavenLocal repo

repositories {
    mavenLocal()
    mavenCentral()
}

Select "Install" task from gradle tasks to install jar to maven local repo from where other projects can pick up by adding mavenLocal repo and dependencies 
for corresponding jars. eg. 

	implementation 'com.xx.microservices:api:1.0.0'
	implementation 'com.xx.microservices:util:1.0.0'

2. @Mockbean returns null for classes setup in @Before method:
=======================================================

As a workaround setup method which was used with @Before method annotation to be called before each test was manually invoked from each test and then MockBean object were made available.

	@MockBean
	private ProductBusinessIntegration integration;

	@Before
	public void setUp() {

		when(integration.getProduct(PRODUCT_ID_OK)).
				thenReturn(new Product(PRODUCT_ID_OK, "name", 1, "mock-address"));
		when(integration.getRecommendations(PRODUCT_ID_OK)).
				thenReturn(singletonList(new Recommendation(PRODUCT_ID_OK, 1, "author", "1", "content", "mock address")));
		when(integration.getReviews(PRODUCT_ID_OK)).
				thenReturn(singletonList(new Review(PRODUCT_ID_OK, 1, "author", "subject", "content", "mock address")));

		when(integration.getProduct(PRODUCT_ID_NOT_FOUND)).thenThrow(new NotFoundException("No product found for productId: " + PRODUCT_ID_NOT_FOUND));

		when(integration.getProduct(PRODUCT_ID_INVALID)).thenThrow(new InvalidInputException("INVALID: " + PRODUCT_ID_INVALID));
	}
  
  	@Test
	public void getProductById() {
		
    setUp();  ///added this method call here specifically as workaround.
    
		getAndVerifyProduct(PRODUCT_ID_OK, OK)
				.jsonPath("$.productId").isEqualTo(PRODUCT_ID_OK)
				.jsonPath("$.recommendations.length()").isEqualTo(1)
				.jsonPath("$.reviews.length()").isEqualTo(1);
	}
  
  3. Suddenly started getting error while executing tests which were running earlier
  ==========================================================================================
  
  Caused by: org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.TestExecutionException: No tests found for given includes:
  
  I changed import in test java class from  
  
  import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test to  import org.junit.Test after which go above error. Reverting to old import fixed the issue.
  
  
 
4. Reactive services springboot based on Project Reactor
=================================================================
   ---- Data types user are Flux (process stream of 0..n elements) and Mono (process stream of 0..1 elements)

5. When changing Product and Recommendation services to use spring data reactive, test were failing as ReactiveCrudRepository was not getting injected
===================================================================================================
  ----made changes to build.gradle to use org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb-reactive instead of
	org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb

6. ApplicationTests failed while calling "block" method on Mono objects.
==============================================================================================

By default spring start webflux uses netty as the reactive server and recent versions of netty do not allow block methods. As a workaround for this application
I have switched from netty as embedded server to tomcat servlet container.

	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webflux') {
		exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot',
				module: 'spring-boot-starter-reactor-netty'
	}
	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat')

7. Useful docker-compose commands

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --scale review=2

docker-compose exec product-composite getent hosts review
172.30.0.7      review
172.30.0.8      review

docker-compose exec --index=1 review cat /etc/hosts

docker-compose exec --index=2 review cat /etc/hosts

Services can be called using above dns entry, but DNS protocol cache first ip and uses it for subsequent requests. It is not suited for microserivces environment where services come and go all the time.
